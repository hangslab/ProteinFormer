# ProteinFormer
Protein subcellular localization model based on bioimages and modified transformer.


## Introduction
We propose an end-to-end protein subcellular localization learning model called ProteinFormer, which combines bioimages with Transformer architecture. By incorporating the ResNet model for feature extraction and harnessing the Transformer network for the effective integration of global information, our model achieves outstanding performance on the Cyto\_2017 dataset, surpassing mainstream vision task methods in both single-label and multi-label tasks. To enhance its applicability, we introduce residual learning principles and additional inductive biases into our GL-Protein model when dealing with small sample sizes from the IHC\_2021 dataset. We replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers (ConvFFN) in order to improve its efficiency further. Ablation and comparative analyses demonstrate that our proposed model exhibits superior predictive capabilities compared to convolution-based methods in visual tasks.

## Architecture

* ProteinFormer model
Architecture diagram of ProteinFormer model. The model architecture is mainly divided into feature extraction part, multi-scale fusion part, image feature serialization part, Transformer part. And finally outputs the learned class token (cls) for classification. The structural details of Transformer are shown on the right side of the figure.
